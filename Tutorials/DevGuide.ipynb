    "# 05 How to Add a New Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add new autoencoder architectures and pipelines, this is highly encouraged!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you find a publication with an interesting architecture called *MySpecialix*.  \n",
    "Here we show how to incorporate this into the *AUTOENCODIX* framework, so that you can use this new architecture in the same way you would use an existing pipeline such as *Varix*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = varix.run(config=config)\n",
    "# then you could also do\n",
    "special_result = myspecialix.run(config=config)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## 1) High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1) High-Level Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a new autoencoder architecture, you need to implement at least two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pipeline in *src/autoencodix/* — analogous to *varix.py*.\n",
    "- One additional piece of functionality, most likely a new architecture, but this may also be:\n",
    "  - a new loss function for an existing architecture, or\n",
    "  - a new method inside the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on complexity and data requirements, you may also add:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model architecture in *src/autoencodix/modeling/* — analogous to *_varix_architecture.py*.\n",
    "- A custom dataset class in *src/autoencodix/data* — analogous to *numeric_dataset.py*.\n",
    "- A custom preprocessor in *src/autoencodix/data* — as in *preprocessor.py*.\n",
    "- A custom trainer in *src/autoencodix/trainers* — as in *_general_trainer.py*, including a custom *predict* method if needed.\n",
    "- A custom loss — as in *xmodal_loss.py*.\n",
    "- A custom visualizer — as in *_xmodal_visualizer.py*.\n",
    "- A custom evaluator for downstream tasks — as in *_xmodalix_evaluator.py*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2) High-Level Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every Autoencodix model is built on the base classes in *src/autoencodix/base*. These (often abstract) classes define the structure for each pipeline stage: preprocessing, fitting, predicting, evaluating, and visualizing. Additional components such as losses are also defined here.\n",
    "- The base classes provide shared functionality, such as how trainers or preprocessors are invoked.\n",
    "- The base classes should not be modified. If custom behavior is needed, override the relevant methods in your child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1) Required Files — Detailed Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You want to add a new architecture named **MySpecial**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add the architecture file\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "*src/autoencodix/modeling/_myspecialix_architecture.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "(Files not intended for end-user import should start with an underscore.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Define your class, for example *MySpecialixArchitecture*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inherit from the base architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Your class should inherit from the base architecture in:\n",
    "\n",
    "*src/autoencodix/base/_base_architecture.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Review the base class\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand which abstract methods you must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Hint: Check existing implementations, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "*src/autoencodix/modeling/_varix_architecture.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add new configuration parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "If your architecture needs new parameters, add them to:\n",
    "\n",
    "*src/autoencodix/configs/default_config.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may later create a custom config for your pipeline, but adding new parameters to the *DefaultConfig* first — with sensible defaults — is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expose your class in *__init__.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "Add *MySpecialixArchitecture* to:\n",
    "\n",
    "*src/autoencodix/modeling/__init__.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    ">Do this for all new classes you add (trainers, preprocessors, losses, etc.).\n",
    ".Always check the base classes first; many functionalities can be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Write tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a test file:\n",
    "\n",
    "*tests/test_modeling/test_myspecialix_architecture.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Explanation: Passing Types Instead of Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Most pipeline functionality comes from the *BasePipeline*.  \n",
    "To customize behavior for the *MySpecialix* pipeline, we pass types of specialized subclasses rather than instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "- During *BasePipeline* initialization, not all parameters required for constructing your specialized subclasses are available yet.\n",
    "- Therefore, only the class types are passed.\n",
    "- *BasePipeline* later creates the actual instances once all required parameters are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "All passed types must inherit from the corresponding base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional components follow the same pattern as the required ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a specialized class inheriting from the appropriate base class.\n",
    "- Pass the type of this specialized class (for example, *MySpecialTrainer*) to your *MySpecialix* pipeline in its *__init__* method — just like you did with *MySpecialixArchitecture*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design keeps pipelines modular, flexible, and consistent across the Autoencodix package.\n"
