    "# How To Use XModalix\n",
    "\n",
    "X-Modalix is our implementation of a cross-modal autoencoder.  \n",
    "This tutorial follows the structure of `Getting Started - Vanillix`, but is less extensive because our pipeline works similarly across different architectures. Here, we focus only on X-Modalix specifics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AUTOENCODIX** supports far more functionality than shown here, so we’ll also point to advanced tutorials where relevant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**\n",
    "\n",
    "> This tutorial only shows the specifics of the XModalix pipeline. If you're unfamiliar with general concepts,  \n",
    "> we recommend following the `Getting Started - Vanillix` tutorial first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## XModalix Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of a cross-modal autoencoder is to align the latent spaces of different data modalities.  \n",
    "Once the latent distributions are aligned, we can translate between modalities by feeding data from one modality into its encoder and then passing the latent space to the decoder of the target modality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying models are separate VAEs—one for each data modality—which are trained in parallel. Their latent spaces are closely aligned so that modalities are hard to discriminate, but sample variation is preserved.  \n",
    "To achieve this alignment, the VAE loss function is extended with the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Adversarial* loss term: In parallel with the VAEs, a third neural network (latent space classifier) is trained to discriminate the embeddings of different modalities. Analogous to a GAN, the inverse of this classifier loss is added to the VAE loss to enforce latent space alignment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Paired* loss term: Alignment is further enforced by minimizing the distance between samples with paired measurements across modalities. While unpaired samples are allowed, we recommend that most samples are paired (present in all modalities).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Class-based* loss term: This semi-supervised term minimizes distances among samples of the same class. Class membership is defined in the annotation data (e.g., cancer type, cell type). In each iteration, the class mean in the latent space is computed, and distances from individual samples to the class mean are minimized. See our `Preprint [TODO]` for more details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jan-forest/autoencodix/729f3e8172a722e7c3681298719d9d4b59e313d9/images/xmodalix_scheme.svg\" alt=\"xmodalix_scheme\" width=\"1200\"/>\n",

    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "As a showcase for data modality translation with X-Modalix, we will use cancer gene expression from TCGA in combination with handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/).  \n",
    "Our goal is to translate gene expression signatures of five selected cancer subtypes into images of digits, with each cancer subtype class mapped to a digit between 0–4.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, these images could be histopathological images or any other data modality.  \n",
    "Before we show data preparation and X-Modalix training, we provide background on cross-modal VAEs as proposed by [Yang & Uhler](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03515).  \n",
    "\n",
    "While following this showcase, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** the pipeline and run it. <br><br>\n",
    "2. Understand the X-Modalix-specific **pipeline steps** (paired vs. unpaired data). <br><br>\n",
    "3. Access X-Modalix-specific **results** (sub-results for modality autoencoders). <br><br>\n",
    "4. **Visualize** and **evaluate** the outputs. <br><br>\n",
    "5. Apply **custom parameters**. <br><br>\n",
    "6. **Save, load, and reuse** a trained pipeline. <br><br>\n",
